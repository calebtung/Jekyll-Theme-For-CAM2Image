# CAM² Image Team K-Base Theme

**Caleb is now maintaining this theme primarily on his [fork of the image team's repo](https://github.com/calebtung/CAM2ImageTeam/tree/gh-pages).**

A simple Jekyll theme for the [Purdue University CAM² Research group's](https://www.cam2project.net/) image team knowledge base.  Inspired by the Visual Studio Code user interface.

> **NOTE:** The image team's K-base is available to the public at [https://purduecam2project.github.io/CAM2ImageTeam](https://purduecam2project.github.io/CAM2ImageTeam/)

This is designed to be deployed on the `gh-pages` branch.
